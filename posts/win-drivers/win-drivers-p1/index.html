        <p>Hello.</p>
<p>This is the first part in the series, &ldquo;Writing Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers for Fun and Profit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This series will help you understand and write KMDF drivers, and maybe exploit them in red team engagements or DoS your own/or others&rsquo; system/VM if you messed up.</p>
<p>A basic <code>DriverEntry</code> routine definition looks something like this -&gt;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-C++" data-lang="C++"><span style="display:flex;"><span>NTSTATUS <span style="color:#a6e22e">DriverEntry</span> (_In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER (DriverObject);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    UNREFERNECED_PARAMETER (RegistryPath);
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> SUCCESS;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>While this may look intimidating at first, brushing up OS Concepts, Windows Internals, C/C++ knowledge, and some persistence will help you better understand stuff that&rsquo;s about to come.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be dealing mostly with Kernel-Mode or KMDF drivers (explained later), so unless explicitly stated, a driver means a KMDF driver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For further details I recommend <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/windows-internals-part-1-system-architecture-processes-9780735684188">Windows Internals</a> by Pavel Yosifovich, Alex Ionescu, Mark E. Russinovich, David A. Solomon and <a href="https://leanpub.com/windowskernelprogrammingsecondedition">Windows Kernel Programming</a> by Pavel Yosifovich</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, <code>DriverEntry</code> is just the <code>main</code> of the driver.</p>
<h3 id="drivers-who-dis">Drivers&hellip; Who dis?<a href="#drivers-who-dis" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Drivers are Structured, High Privilege loadable Kernel modules operating in Ring 0 processor privilege level, same as kernel. Initially, Ring 1 and Ring 2 were reserved for drivers but nobody uses them anymore.</p>
<p>Drivers provide a way to interact with (in most cases) hardware devices. These are called Hardware Drivers. On the contrary, software components that execute kernel-level privilege tasks such as file creation, are classified under Software Drivers.</p>
<p>To write drivers, you need to follow a set of guidelines, conventions, and structures, all these together combine to form a Driver Framework. Two of these exist -&gt; Windows Driver Model (WDM) and Windows Driver Foundation (WDF).</p>
<h3 id="wdm-vs-wdf">WDM vs WDF<a href="#wdm-vs-wdf" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simply put, WDM is older, more-complex-to-work-with framework to write drivers. Ideal for writing File Systems or File System Filter drivers, WDM provides greater control over kernel objects and is hard to write, debug, and maintain.</p>
<p>WDM objects are system-wide objects accessible to drivers and are referenced by pointers. A driver that corrupts a WDM object corrupts the entire system. WDM drivers are trusted kernel components, hence OS does less checks to validate data.</p>
<p>From a security perspective, leveraging a framework that provides higher control than WDF, would enable more stealth during offensive engagements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WDF is a new, easier-to-work-with framework that abstracts a lot details of WDM. It supports a coherent object model in which objects are invisible to drivers.</p>
<p>Corrupting a WDF Driver is not only more difficult - as the framework evalutates data being supplied - but also causes system wide problems less often.</p>
<p>Apart from these, there many more subtle differences such as how both handle I/O requests. For eg. In a WDM driver, I/O dispatch routines map to particular IRP codes where in a WDF driver, the framework registers its own dispatch routines, follows some identical steps to WDM and then invoke driver&rsquo;s event callback functions.</p>
<p>Event callback functions do a more specific task than general I/O dispatch routines of WDM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of details, the bottom-line is, WDM is complex and much harder to work with while WDF is easier to understand, tradeoff being the abstraction.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements<a href="#requirements" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>There are some tools and methodologies that are recommended while working with drivers.</p>
<p>To build and deploy drivers you require Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and Visual Studio 2022 (latest as of this writing).</p>
<p>To test drivers, you&rsquo;ll need a Windows VM, with Windows SDK and WDK installed.</p>
<p>SysInternals Tools is a must.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a href="#final-thoughts" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Driver Development is not something you do regularly, unless you have to. The purpose is to understand Windows internals and drivers in order to build anything from Anti-Virus Filter Driver to Rootkits. Knowing Driver Development also develops Kernel Debugging skills which are great if you are interested in Windows vulnerability research.</p>
<p>In Part 2, you&rsquo;ll learn Windows Internals required to getting started with drivers.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned.</p>
